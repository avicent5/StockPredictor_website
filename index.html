        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
            This project investigates the prediction of stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
             Initially, we introduce the core concepts of neural networks and the preprocessing steps required for time series data.
              We frame stock price prediction as a time series forecasting task, emphasizing the importance of data temporal sequence. 
              The study then dives into the specifics of RNNs and LSTMs, highlighting their adeptness at handling sequential data and capturing long-term patterns.
               Furthermore, we integrate financial indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to enhance prediction accuracy.
